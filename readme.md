# Python Crash Course

This is an introductory course to Python programming for beginner learners coming from the BAP over a 4 weeks duration.

# Goal

At the end of this crash course, each learner must be able to:
- Write clean and documented Python3 code
- Write unit test to validate Python3 code
- Solve algorithmic problems using Python3
- Version code and collaborate on a programming project
- Evaluate the code space and time complexity.
