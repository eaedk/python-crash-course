# Week 01

# Introduction
This week we will start programming using Python3 and we will explore the following topics:
- Algorithm, Python code overall structure & I/O
- Code Version Control (Versioning) using Git & Github
- Variables and Data Structures
- Conditional statements
- Loop statements

# What is programming ?
Programming means using code, written in a programming language, based on an algorithm, to make a computer perform desired actions or to solve some problems.

# What is an algorithm ?
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

An algorithm has some main components that are implemented differently with each programming language.


Let's have a look to some algorithms components through Python code 

# Python code

```pyhton 
def greetings(name, hour):
    """Descrition: this is a function that uses the correct greeting depending on the time 
    
    parameters
    ----------
    name () :  .
    hour () :  .

    """
    hour 
    if 
```
