## Objectives
Write a program that prints out all the elements of a list below a given number.

## Guidelines
- Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the use
- Instead of printing the elements one by one, create a new list that contains only the elements you want.

## Starter code
Your program must be written in a file named `list_filtered.py`.
 
```Python
"""
Ask for a number and return only the elements in the list below that number.
"""

def main():
    full_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 11, 13, 21, 22, 29, 29, 30, 34, 55, 59, 64, 67, 72, 89, 93, 99]

    # TODO: ask for the user to enter a number below 100 as `filter`


    # TODO: create the `list_filtered` and populate it. Print out your result.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

### Bonus
Write this in one line of Python.
